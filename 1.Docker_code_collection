Introduction to Docker
Docker is a tool set to create containers and version it. For those who have more experience with Linux, they probably already know what a container is 
by using the command chroot on Linux. In simple words, a container is a directory in your file system that allows you to install another Linux operating 
system in it.As the command says chroot (change root), so the new root directory /, will be the new one that you set. However, an entire operating system 
needs so much more than just the files. Then, for the networking part, the Docker uses iptables under the hood.

To manage some redirects via NAT rules, I will show you the amount of stuff that Docker manages for you by running some simple commands in the following 
paragraphs.

Installation(1st Section)
=========================================================================================================================================
Firstly, we need to install Docker in our environment. In the official documentation, you will find all the steps and the detailed instructions. Here, 
we have a summary of everything:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
sudo su -
apt clean
apt-get update
apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc -y
==================================================================================================================================================
The preceding commands will remove any previous installation of Docker, if you had one in your machine:
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupgagent software-properties-common -y
=================================================================================================================================================
Now, we are just installing some dependencies that are required for your Docker installation, like the apt-transport-https, which is a requirement to 
download packages from the https repositories:
===================================================================================================================================================
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
================================================================================================================
The following command will add GNU Privacy Guard key to ensure the authenticity of the Docker repository:
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
==============================================================================================================================================
We are using Ubuntu. So, the preceding command is specifically for Ubuntu environments:
apt-get update -y
apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
================================================================================================================================================
To conclude, the previous command were to update your local repositories list
and install the Docker Community Edition.
