Creating Containers(Topic 2)
=========================================================================================================================================================
The environment is ready. To ensure that your Docker is running fine, run the following command:
=======================================================================================================================================================
root@devops:~# systemctl status docker
docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled;
vendor preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-04-02 10:28:47 UTC; 1min
7s ago
Docs: https://docs.docker.com
Main PID: 6464 (dockerd)
Tasks: 9
CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
└─6464 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --
containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
Now, your Docker installation is active and running. 
===================================================================================================================================================
To create one container,you can just type the following command:     (Topic3)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
root@devops:~# docker run -ti centos /bin/bash
Unable to find image 'centos:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/centos
8a29a15cefae: Downloading
[=================================================>]
72.58MB/73.23MB
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                                                                     (Topic4)
The previous command means that we need to run a new container with a TTY (terminal), which is represented by the parameter -t, and an interactive,
represented by the parameter -i. Thus, we can run the commands in the container terminal and see their outputs.
=================================================================================================================================================
When your container is created, you can see the following output:
root@devops:~# docker run -ti centos /bin/bash
Unable to find image 'centos:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/centos
8a29a15cefae: Pull complete
Digest:
sha256:fe8d824220415eed5477b63addf40fb06c3b049404242b31982106ac204f6700
Status: Downloaded newer image for centos:latest
=================================================================================================================================================
[root@595b42fceebc /]#
The last line is the important one:
If you compare with our terminal in before running the command:
root@devops:~# docker run -ti centos /bin/bas
===================================================================================================================================================
                                                                         (Topic 5)
You can clearly see that the hostname is changed, which means now we are within the container and all the commands we will run, starting from now, will
be running inside the container, and nothing will be installed in the VM environment. The hostname name given to the container 595b42fceebc is the
container ID, which is used to manage your container. To exit from your container, type: exit or Ctrl + D:
[root@595b42fceebc /]#
exit
root@devops:~#
====================================================================================================================================================
                                                                         (Topic 6)
To see your current running containers, type the following command:
root@devops:~#docker container ls
CONTAIANER ID   IMAGE    COMMAND CREATED STATUS  PORTS NAMES

We can see zero containers running. It happens because once you type exit or Ctrl + D from your container terminal, the container stops. 
To see that, type the following command:
root@devops:~#docker container ls -a
CONTAIANER ID   IMAGE    COMMAND     CREATED STATUS   PORTS                  NAMES
595b42fceebc    centos   "bin/bash"  9mins ago        Exited 2mins ago       sumit
===================================================================================================================================================
Important Points:--
1.Now, you can see your container created. If you give a look, you can see that the value in the column CONTAINER ID is exactly the same as the container
hostname
[root@595b42fceebc /]#
2.However, why does the Docker has this behavior? Why is it that when we exit from a container, the container stops? This happens because in the containers
concept, one container is created for one specific purpose, different from the virtual machines. So, we do not need to concern about uptime or maintaining 
a container. You can just delete it and create a new one. If you want to make changes into a container, you must modify the image, save it, delete the 
current container, and start a new one with the new version of the image when we created it.
3.In my case, I created a container based on a CentOS image, and I just ran the command /bin/bash, which was keeping my container alive. Once that
command stops running, the container becomes dead. It also applies for the container configurations. If you want to change a redirect or any other
parameters, you must create a new container with those new parameters, save it, and run a new container.
======================================================================================================================================================
                                                                    Topic 7
Now, we will create a new container based in the CentOS image, and within this container, we will put a Python application that we learned in the last
chapter:
root@devops:~# docker run -ti --name python_app -p 5000:5000 centos /bin/bash
[root@ce7f74b0304a /]#
The creation now was clearly faster than the first one. This happens because the CentOS image is already in our local repository. Therefore, the Docker 
does not need to download it again.
