Structure of directories
To see the basic structure of the directories on Linux, use the following command:
alisson@devops:~$ ls /
bin cdrom etc initrd.img lib lost+found mnt proc run snap swap.img tmp var vmlinuz.old
boot dev home initrd.img.old lib64 media opt root sbin srv sys usr vmlinuz
===========================================================================================================================================
Topic 2
we have some directories. I will explain just the most important of them:
/: It is the root directory and everything that runs in your Linux system is below this directory.
/etc: This directory stores all the configuration files on Linux.
/var: This directory stores the log files and data of some services. For example, if you have a MySQL server installed in your system, you can
find all the data stored inside /var/lib/mysql/data.
/lib: Here you will find the libraries of your system. We do not have to often access this directory, but it is an important one to know. For example,
the kernel modules are stored in /lib/modules.
/bin: This directory stores the binaries. In other words, the programs are required for your Linux Words. For example, the command ls, it is found
in this directory.
/usr: Here you can find some binaries, like the /bin. But the binaries installed here are not required for your system works. For example,
/usr/bin/at, this binary allows you to schedule a task to run in your system, but you can live without that.
/boot: In this directory, you can find your kernel installed. My current version is: /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-76-generic.
/proc: This is the current process running. One fact about this directory is it only exists when your Linux is turned on. If you have a dual boot and
you try to mount your Linux partition, you will be able to see all the directories, except the /proc, because it is your RAM content.
/opt: Usually, it becomes empty after your installation. But, when you compile a program, it is a good practice to put the binaries and the
configuration files in this directory.
/sbin: This is exactly like the /bin, but the binaries here require administration permissions. For example, if you want to format a partition,
you will call the command /sbin/fdisk. You cannot run this command as a common user.
/home: In this directory, you will find the home directory of all the common users. The only exception is the user root; its home directory can
be found in /root.
/mnt: Here, you can use to mount network shares; your pendrive, SD card,and another kind of external volumes.
=============================================================================================================================================
Topic 3
Now that you already know the important directories, let's get inside of them and see the files that are important for our system to work.
One important file is the /etc/passwd. This file is responsible to store all the Linux users, and we can give a look at its content using the cat command:
alisson@devops:~$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
=============================================================================================================================================
This was an example of the first 5 lines. Its structure follows the following sequence:
User – password – user id – group id – comment – home folder - shell
The data is separated by a colon (:). It is important to know that the Linux shell has many useful commands to work with these kinds of files.
For example, we could use the command cut to see just the information we want:
=============================================================================================================================================
Topic 4
alisson@devops:~$ cut -f 1,6,7 -d : /etc/passwd
root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
Thus, in the example, I printed just the columns 1, 6, 7 which correspond to the user, the home folder, and the shell.I am not posting the entire output 
of the command because I want to save some space. But, you probably are running this on your own virtual machine. So, if you want to show just the first 
3 lines of any file, you can use the command head. By default, this command shows the first 10 lines of a file, but we have the -n parameter, where we can
define as many lines we want to see.
For example:
alisson@devops:~$ head -n 3 /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
===============================================================================================================================================
Topic 5
On Linux, it is also possible to concatenate the commands. If you want to see just the first 3 lines and only the columns 1, 6, 7 like we did with the 
cut command, we can use the pipe (|). This statement has the function of getting the output of the last command and sending it to the next command in the 
pipeline.
Example:
alisson@devops:~$ head -n3 /etc/passwd | cut -f 1,6,7 -d :
root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
============================================================================================================================================
Topic 6
Therefore, every time that you want to concatenate the commands, you must use the pipe (|). One interesting point is the second columns of the /etc/passwd 
file.I wrote that it is the password, but we can only see an x, this character represents the encrypted password. The hash can be found in the file 
/etc/shadow:
alisson@devops:~$ sudo head -n3 /etc/shadow
[sudo] password for alisson:
root:*:18113:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:18113:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:18113:0:99999:7:::
===============================================================================================================================================
Topic 7
To see the content of this file, you need to run the command sudo before the command head. The sudo command means the substitute users do. In a simple
way, we are running the command head as we were another user. If you do not specify the user, by default, the user is root. The password is the same as 
we set in the installation. If you set the same password as me, it’s devops.
To see your user's password, we can use the command grep. This command will find the line which corresponds with our criteria of the search.
Example:
alisson@devops:~$ sudo grep alisson /etc/shadow
alisson:$6$aeR.OxEqoVMnyUuq$eYxtbG6V.156mtlsK9QBZcVOjQZBm7NlcKFn5x1y
xF4mffuLYd6Wmz2R9V2iKZvuC7fgp96H7.jlQW/o7OenF/:18292:0:99999:7:::
=============================================================================================================================================
Now you can clearly see the password hash in the second column. Of course, we cannot decrypt it, but if you want to take a Linux certification, you will 
need to record this file and the structures. However, we can also remove a user's password. You can just edit this file and delete the hash. This way, 
the user will not have a password and he can set a new one in the future.
=======================================================================================================================================
Topic 8
Regarding the users, we also have one file on Linux to manage the groups. This file is located in /etc/group:
alisson@devops:~$ head -n 3 /etc/group
root:x:0:
daemon:x:1:
bin:x:2:
This file follows the following sequence:
Group name | password | group id | users
So, the users added into a group will appear in the last column of each line. As I explained earlier, we can use the command grep to find a group and see 
which users were added into it:
============================================================================================================
Topic 9
alisson@devops:~$ grep sudo /etc/group
sudo:x:27:alisson
It shows us one interesting thing; the command sudo only allows the users who belong to the sudo group to use the command. Another important file is the
/etc/fstab. This file is responsible to mount our volumes during the boot. Let's give it a look:
#########################################################################################################################
alisson@devops:~$ cat /etc/fstab
UUID=75fbe5e6-26ff-4522-abc4-0d8a3ac69c5b / ext4 defaults 0 0
/swap.img none swap sw 0 0
When you work with Linux, it is really important for you to know the structure of the files. So, this file is organized in the following sequence:
Partition – folder – filesystem type – mounting options – backup enable – disk check sequence
Nowadays, this command lets you see the first column with a uuid, which represents a partition. If you want to see where it binds, run the following
command:
alisson@devops:~$ blkid
/dev/sda2: UUID="75fbe5e6-26ff-4522-abc4-0d8a3ac69c5b" TYPE="ext4"
PARTUUID="7177f53d-2db2-49cb-93a9-21d763cac088"
If you check, it is exactly the same in the /etc/fstab. If you want to change, you can just replace the uuid in the file to /dev/sda2. It will work in the
same way. The machine's hostname is stored in the /etc/hostname:
alisson@devops:~$ cat /etc/hostname
###############################################################################################################################
Topic 10
If you want to change the hostname, you can just edit this file. We also have the /etc/hosts file that you can map an IP address to a name, as we did in 
the DNS:
alisson@devops:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 devops
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
It is very useful when you are developing a web system and you don't want to
type the IP address in the browser every time a really important file is
/etc/sudores:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
alisson@devops:~$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
[sudo] password for alisson:
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead
of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults env_reset
Defaults mail_badpass
Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
# Host alias specification
# User alias specification
# Cmnd alias specification
# User privilege specification
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
# See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
This file is responsible to manage who can use the sudo command. I explained
earlier, the only users in the group sudo can run the command. But, how does the
command know which group it needs to use? Because of the following line:
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
You can put more groups in this file or you can put the users directly, like the
following line:
# User privilege specification
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
One thing that is nice to work with Linux is since all the documentation comes
inside the files, like we saw in the /etc/sudoers, the comments explain how and
where you have to edit the file. We also have the command man for that:
alisson@devops:~$ man sudo
