1.Commands:-->ip a
The preceding command will show all the network interfaces you have and their IP address, like the following screenshot:
We just have 2 IP addresses and 2 interfaces:
Interface: lo
IP Address: 127.0.0.1
This is the local IP address. It is used to make the TCP/IP connection without
getting outside of the machine:
Interface: enp0s
IP Address: 10.0.2.15
=======================================================================================================================
######Topic 2
Virtual machine Configuration
This is a NAT interface. We need this interface just to make the internet connection. But, we cannot access the machine from outside using this
configuration. It is used just for the installation purposes. We could have changed that before. However, I wanted to show you how to change that
configuration and why we need to do it.
=============================================================================================================================
#######Topic 3
To change this configuration, go to the main screen of the VirtualBox. Now,click on the virtual machine, and then, click on Settings | Network. In this 
part,Attached, you will see the value Nat. Change it to the Bridge Network, and in the option Name: select the network interface that you have the internet
access to.In my case, it is configured like the following screenshot:
After saving the configuration, go back to your VM and run the following
command again:
ip a
You will see a new IP address. In my case,192.168.178.62 was attached:

###Topic 4
Accessing via SSH
We have a connection from the outside now. So, how can we connect to that machine using the SSH? In the past, it was common to use tools like Putty to
SSH the servers from Windows machines, but in the new versions of Windows,we have PowerShell, which is installed by default and we can use it to access 
our VM.
Open the PowerShell if you're using Windows or Terminal in Linux/MacOS, and run the following command:
ssh alisson@192.168.178.62
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
####Topic 5
The command follows the structure USER@HOSTNAME. If you do not have a hostname configured, you can use the IP address. After that, press Enter. It will
show you the following message:
The authenticity of host '192.168.178.62 (192.168.178.62)' can't be
established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is
SHA256:GX474/IAL/VeIoiV/r6WoPZHRg3HfFTS3tfvigA9jKM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.178.62' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
===================================================================================================================================================
#####Topic 6
It happens because this is the first time you are connecting to that server. You can just type Yes to make sure that you want to connect to it and then,
the SSH will ask for your password:
alisson@192.168.178.62's password:
Type the password defined in your installation. In my case, it was DevOps, and you will be able to access the Linux shell again:

#####Topic 7
There is a lot of theory and concepts about the SSH connections which are encrypted, and we have the known_hosts files. It is important to know if 
you want to become a Linux expert, but not that important for us now.We know that using a password to access the server is not the best practice,
because they are a lot reliable and are easily exposed. So, we can create a key pair to secure our access. You can exit from your shell by typing the 
following command:
alisson@devops:~$ logout
Connection to 192.168.178.62 closed.
Or press Ctrl + D. In your PowerShell console, type the following command
=============================================================================================================================
#########Topic 7
ssh-keygen
And press Enter for all the options. This command will generate two files for you:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
id_rsa: id_rsa is your private key. This should be in your PC, and only you can have this file.
id_rsa.pub: id_rsa.pub is the public key. You will copy this file to every Linux server you want to access without a password.
To copy your public key to our server, run the following command:
scp .\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
alisson@192.168.178.62:/home/alisson/id_rsa.pub
alisson@192.168.178.62's password:
id_rsa.pub
100% 398 397.4KB/s 00:00
The file was copied, so access the server again:
ssh alisson@192.168.178.62
alisson@192.168.178.62's password:
============================================================================================================================
Create the .ssh directory and create the authorized_keys file. This file will store all the public keys to access the server using the user 
alisson:
mkdir .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
logout
====================================================================================================================================
Now, if you try to access the server again, no password will be asked, like the
following example:
ssh alisson@192.168.178.62
